Petters is school project where we had one week to discover Kotlin and build an app from scratch. It resulted with Petters, and Tinder like for pets !

### Disclaimer

- The profile part is not implemented
- It was the first time we were doing a "real" Android project, so it's a bit buggy and the things we did would probably not be done the same way now.
